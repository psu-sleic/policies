You must pass the safety quiz to work in the control room or the scanner room. There are 18 questions. You may miss 3 and still pass. You may ask for clarification and retake the test.

1.	The magnet is turned off 
	- a. At the end of the work day
	- b. Between participants
	- c. On weekends 
	- d. Never

2. Which of the following conditions should prevent a person from entering the scanner room?
	- a. Pregnancy
	- b. Hip replacement
	- c. Surgical clips
	- d. Cardiac pacemaker

3. Small ferrous objects in your pocket are
	- a. a danger only during a scan
	- b. at risk of becoming projectiles as you approach the magnet
	- c. shielded from the magnetic field 
	- d. are not a problem because they are in your pocket

4. The characteristic banging noise during an MRI scan
	- a. is the result of rapidly expanding liquid helium
	- b. may distort time and space
	- c. results from the twisting force of the rapidly changing gradient fields
	- d. increases in frequency as patient weight increases

5. Rapidly changing magnetic fields during a scan
	- a. may induce electrical currents in coiled or crossed wires
	- b. increase the range of telemetry
	- c. routinely cause visual hallucinations
	- d. produce helium gas 

6. What effects can the rapidly changing gradients have on patients during an EPI scan
	- a. diplopia
	- b. magneto-hemodynamic effect
	- c. tissue heating
	- d. involuntary muscle contractions

7. The strength of the magnetic field 
	- a. is only important when the magnet is scanning
	- b. increases with little warning as you approach the magnet
	- c. repels most large metallic objects
	- d. is only important when dealing with nonferrous objects

8. Radio frequency waves in MRI
	- a. are used in X-rays
	- b. maintain helium in a liquid state
	- c. are usually turned to a local station
	- d. are converted to heat in the participant’s tissue

9. The term “quench” as used in an MRI setting describes
	- a. the thirst a participant experiences from a contrast injection
	- b. a daily procedure used to tune the RF settings 
	- c. a failure of the helium containment system 
	- d. a procedure that happens at the end of the day

10. A participant lets you know they have been scanned many times so there is no reason to fill out the screening form. 
	- a. True
	- b. False

11. During an EPI sequence, what can you do to reduce the effects of peripheral nerve stimulation?
	- a. Change the participant into scrubs
	- b. Using sandbags and/or immobilization pads
	- c. Have the participant remove their eye makeup
	- d. Have the participant uncross their extremities (arms & legs)

12. When would you need to push the quench button?
	- a. There is a fire in the scanner
	- b. An OPP employee walked into the room with a tool belt and a hammer flew into the magnet and is stuck
	- c. A floor buffer was taken into the room and has pinned someone to the magnet
	- d. All of the above

13. Who needs to be screened before entering the scanner room?
	- a. The participant
	- b. The researcher
	- c. The MRI technologist
	- d. All individuals must be screened prior to entering the scanner room 

14.  Which of the following could cause a participant to be burned?
	- a. Tattoos
	- b. Skin touching the bore of the magnet
	- c. Conductive loop of wire on the body surface
	- d. All of the above

15. A bobby pin flies into the magnet. No one was injured, and the MRI technologist removed the bobby pin.  You would
	- a. Report this to the SLEIC Director and MRI Safety Officer
	- b. Since there were no injuries there is no need to report this
	- c. Assume the MRI technologist will report this to the MRI Safety Officer

16. Two OPP personnel have entered the control room with all of their tools.  You would
	- a. assume they must be safety trained if they are in the control room, so it must be fine
	- b. ask them if they are here to work on the magnet and let them in the scanner room
	- c. ask them to wait in the waiting area until you find a SLEIC staff member to handle the situation 
	- d. The 3T door is closed so there is no danger

17. Which of the following objects could become projectiles in the scanner room?
	- a. Hair pins
	- b. Scissors
	- c. Pens
	- d. Oxygen tanks
	- e. All of the above

18. If a participant has an object implanted that is deemed MR Safe at 1.5 T, but has not yet been tested in the 3T environment. You would
	- a. Scan the participant since it is MR safe for a 1.5 T
	- b. Scan the participant but check in with them after each sequence to make sure they feel ok
	- c. Scan the participant only after verifying on www.mrisafety.com that the object is safe at 1.5T
	- d. Not scan the participant since the object has not been deemed safe at 3T
